            <p>Nerissa Natalie Asuncion, often called nena by her peers, spent much of her childhood playing cashier with her neighbors. In the summers of her early adolescence, she put her marketing to use and sold Ice Candy, Halo-halo, and other snacks to battle the heat. Amused by the income she gained, she wondered what else she could sell.</p>
	    <p>She learned different crafts and recipes, and soon enough she was marketing intricately designed bracelets and delicious desserts to her classmates. Even her teachers bought from her and were in awe at the brilliance of this little girl. She continued to earn income from her products and she saved the money.</p>
	    <p>When Nena entered college, she got more busy. She wanted to continue selling different products but she found that she lacked time to create them. She then had the idea of starting a sari-sari store. She thought that she had enough saved from past ventures to start at least a small one, buying supplies in bulk would take much less time than making different products, and that there wasn't a sari-sari store in her village.</p>
	    <p>So she started her sari-sari store. She watched over it on a daily basis, and it was there that she did her schoolwork. It ended up being successful too, as her neighbors thought it very convenient to finally have a store closer to home.</p>
